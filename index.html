  <p>Hi there!</p>
  <p>I am Yan, a third-year doctoral student in computer science at Aalto University, Finland. I am supervised by <a href="http://www.mkivela.com/">Prof. Mikko Kivel&#228;</a> and advised by <a href="https://users.aalto.fi/~kellerb1/">Dr. Barbara Keller</a>.</p>
  <p>My research interest lies in developing and deploying computational methods for analyzing user dynamics in online systems, currently focused on opinion (de)polarization on social media. In general, I like conducting research that helps us better understand how people think, feel, and interact on the internet, especially in the presence of undesired phenomena (e.g., opinion polarization, toxic or sarcastic language).</p>
  <p>Please see <a href="/resume.html">Resume</a> for a more complete list of my experience, and <a href="/projects.html">Projects</a> for an introduction of my major research projects. If you are interested, some of my photography, design, and calligraphy works are presented in <a href="/gallery.html">Gallery</a>.</p>
  <p>Find me by <a href="mailto:yan.xia@aalto.fi">email:yan.xia@aalto.fi</a> or <a href="https://www.twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username| cgi_escape | escape }}">Twitter:yanxxia</a> if you want to talk! :D</p>
