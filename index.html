  <p>Hi! I am Yan, a final-year Doctoral Candidate in Computer Science at Aalto University, Finland. I am supervised by <a href="http://www.mkivela.com/">Prof. Mikko Kivel&#228;</a> and advised by <a href="https://users.aalto.fi/~kellerb1/">Dr. Barbara Keller</a>. I expect to graduate by October 2025 and I am now actively looking for postdoctoral positions.</p>
  <p> I am a computational social scientist who aims to conduct solid research that bridges computer science and social science. My main interest lies in understanding the organic socio-psychological processes underlying negative phenomena in online systems, such as opinion polarization, political (anti-)fandom, and toxic language. I use various computational tools in natural language processing and network analysis to answer my research questions. My work has been published in venues including <i>CSCW</i>, <i>ICWSM</i>, and <i>EPJ Data Science</i>.</p>
  <p>Please see <a href="/resume.html">Resume</a> for a more complete list of my experience, and <a href="/projects.html">Projects</a> for an introduction of my major research projects. If you are interested, some of my photography, design, and calligraphy works can be found in <a href="/gallery.html">Gallery</a>.</p>
  <p>Find me by <a href="mailto:yan.xia@aalto.fi">email:yan.xia@aalto.fi</a> if you want to talk!</p>
