          <li><b>RQ</b>: Are users ever depolarized in Reddit political discussions? If so, in what form does depolarization manifest, and how does it differ between subreddits?</li>
          <li><b>Data</b>: Posts on political topics in r/ChangeMyView, r/AskTrumpSupporters, r/AskALiberal, r/AskConservatives, r/askaconservative, r/politics, r/PoliticalDiscussion, etc.
          <li><b>Method</b>: A pipeline that combines <i>small-scale qualitative reading</i> and <i>large-scale quantitative coding using large language models (LLMs)</i>.</li>
          <li><b>Findings</b>:
            <ul>
              <li>Users <i>do get depolarized</i> in Reddit political discussions, manifested in at least five different ways: <i>finding common ground, better understanding a different view, acknowledging new perspective/information, re-evaluating own view, and changing own view</i>.</li>
              <li>However, the frequency and types of manifested user depolarization largely differ between subreddits: for example, <i>depolarization occurs much more frequently in r/ChangeMyView</i> than in other subreddits, while <i>view change almost exclusively occurs in r/ChangeMyView</i>.</li>

        <ul>
          <li><b>RQ</b>: What features of a political conversation on Reddit best predict if a user will get more polarized by it?</li>
          <li><b>Data</b>: Triads of <i>comment (C), reply (R), and reply of reply (R2)</i> in r/politics, where the comment (C) and the reply of reply (R2) are posted by the same user, while the comment (C) author and the reply (R) author likely support different political parties given their subreddit participation.</li>
          <li><b>Method</b>: Fitting a regression model where the predictors are the <i>comment (C) and reply (R) features (e.g., toxicity, emotions, politeness)</i>, and the outcome is an LLM-produced label of <i>whether the comment (C) author is more polarized at the reply of reply (R2) level</i>.</li>
          <li><b>Finding</b>: Comment (C) features seem to be more effective than reply (R) features in predicting user polarization at the reply of reply (R2) level, which suggests that the occurrence of polarization may be more closely related to the characteristics of the <i>polarized</i> user, than to those of the <i>polarizing</i> user.

          <li>We investigated <i>how the Russian invasion of Ukraine in Feb 2022 depolarized the NATO discussion on Finnish Twitter</i>.</li>
          <li>By analyzing retweet networks, we found three separate user groups before the invasion: a <i>pro-NATO</i>, a <i>left-wing anti-NATO</i>, and a <i>conspiracy-charged anti-NATO</i> group.</li>
          <li>We found that after the invasion, the <i>left-wing anti-NATO group members connected with the pro-NATO group despite their difference in partisanship</i>, while the <i>conspiracy-charged anti-NATO group mostly remained a separate cluster</i>.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>We developed an implementation of the multilayer diffusion network inference framework using GPU computing, which outperforms previous implementations in accuracy within comparable runtime.</li>
          <li>We <i>systematically analyzed the performance of the multilayer diffusion network inference framework</i> under varied network structure and information diffusion settings that are designed to mimic real-world spreading on social media.</li>
          <li>Our results show extreme performance variation of the inference framework: notably, it fails to decompose the diffusion network correctly when most cascades in the data reach a limited audience, or when the ground-truth diffusion network is sparse.</li>
          <li>Our work highlights the need to carefully evaluate the applicability of the inference before running it on real data: our results serve as a reference for this evaluation, and our publicly available implementation supports further testing under personalized settings.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>We looked at <i>what types of tweets go viral</i> among climate activists/skeptics during the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize announcement.</li>
          <li>We identified a climate activist group and a climate skeptic group by applying a graph clustering algorithm on the retweet network.</li>
          <li>We prepared our dataset by manually labelling the themes of ~400 popular tweets, and inferring the virality of each tweet by fitting a cascade model to its spreading traces. Then, we used a lasso model to identify the relationship between tweet theme and tweet virality.</li>
          <li>We found the <i>discussion of climate movement</i> to be the most viral theme among the climate activists, and the <i>use of uncivil language</i> to be the most viral theme among the climate skeptics.</li>
          <li>While these two themes clearly reflect different types of bonds that tie each community together, they both function to enhance ingroup connections and repulse outgroup engagement. This reveals the potential for within-group viral spreading and out-group information exposure to exacerbate polarization on climate Twitter.</li>
